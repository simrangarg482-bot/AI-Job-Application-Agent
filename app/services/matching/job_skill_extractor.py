Extract ONLY skills/technologies explicitly required or clearly implied by the job description.
Also extract a broader list of ATS-relevant keywords: specific tools, certifications,
methodologies (e.g. "Agile", "Scrum"), and exact terms an Applicant Tracking System
would scan for verbatim — these can overlap with required_skills but should also include
softer/broader terms a resume keyword-matcher would look for.
Do not invent requirements that aren't stated or strongly implied.
Output ONLY valid JSON, no markdown, no commentary.
